Hi, this is my first project in Django, simple library which is showing all books you would add(in progress). Every book has individual
website automaticly rendered, all the data you added to that book will show there, fully working search bar. I'm still working and improving this
project, for now I'm focused on backend, not at the frontend so it looks like crap.
